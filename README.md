# Mars-Rover-
Code2College Elite 102 Project 

This project is designed to help someone interning at a company with a specific language, in my case javascript. The project is supposed to last 4 weeks or less. 

Who doesn’t love space? Using NASA’s public Mars Rover Photo API allow the user to search for different Mars Rover pictures. Allow the user to search by date and search for images from a particular rover and from a particular rover camera. 

### Framework: React

## Weekly milestones:
By the end of week 1, students have successfully created a basic “Hello World” site
By the end of week 2, students have successfully added basic user interactions and received JSON data from API
By the end of week 3, students have successfully displayed info from the APIs to the end user and begun adding tests
By the end of week 4, students have successfully made the website look pretty with CSS ex: change the background color, set a custom font, change the formatting of the data to be easier to understand. This step will be determined largely by the students own creativity
